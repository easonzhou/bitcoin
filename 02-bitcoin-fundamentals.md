# Bitcoin Fundamentals

## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin (BTC) is the **first decentralized digital currency**, created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto**.

## Key Features

### 1. Digital Currency
- Exists only in digital form
- No physical coins or bills
- Peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries

### 2. Limited Supply
- Maximum 21 million bitcoins will ever exist
- Scarcity built into the protocol
- Creates deflationary characteristics

### 3. Decentralized
- No government or bank controls it
- Runs on a global network of computers (nodes)
- No single point of failure

## How Bitcoin Works

### Wallets
- **Public Key**: Like your bank account number (shareable)
- **Private Key**: Like your password (keep secret!)
- Used to send and receive Bitcoin

### Transactions
1. You initiate a transaction using your private key
2. Transaction is broadcast to the network
3. Miners verify and include it in a block
4. Block is added to the blockchain
5. Transaction is confirmed

### Mining
- Process of validating transactions and creating new blocks
- Miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles
- Winner gets newly created bitcoins (block reward) + transaction fees
- Currently 6.25 BTC per block (halves every 4 years)
